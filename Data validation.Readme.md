# Excel Data Validation Practice

This repository contains an example dataset and instructions to practice various data validation techniques in Excel.
The dataset includes columns like **ID**, **Name**, **Age**, **Email**, **Joining Date**, **Department**, **Salary**, **Rating**, **Manager**, and **Phone Number**,
which can be used to apply a range of validation rules.
### Data Validation Techniques

1. **Whole Number or Decimal Validation (Age between 20 and 40)**
2. **Name must be whithin 30 charecters (giving an input message).**
3. **Gives a list of departments as a dropdown list.**
4. **Prevents entering a duplicate ID using custom validation and formulas(=COUNTIF($A$2:$A$13, A2) = 1).**
5. **Message for Salary must be in currency.**
6. **Phone number must be 10 charecters using text validation and condition.**
