# Excel Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of advanced Excel functions, specifically **INDEX**, **MATCH**, and **INDIRECT**, for data analysis and retrieval. These functions enhance data manipulation and allow for dynamic referencing in spreadsheets.

## Functions Used
- **INDEX**: Retrieves the value of a cell in a specified row and column of a given range.
- **MATCH**: Searches for a specified item in a range and returns the relative position of that item.
- **INDIRECT**: Returns the reference specified by a text string, allowing for dynamic referencing of ranges.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to showcase how these functions can be combined to create flexible and powerful data analysis tools in Excel. This is particularly useful for handling large datasets where direct references may not be practical.
